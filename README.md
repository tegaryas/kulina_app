# Kulina Preliminary Test

This was a repo for Kulina App

I use sqflite to save data from json to local storage, and use GetX for State Management. So when you add a item or product to keranjang, it will storage to local cart and we can retrivied cart data from sqflite to UI.

It not perfect need more improvement for future and I got much lesson in this case. 

Thank You so Much :)
